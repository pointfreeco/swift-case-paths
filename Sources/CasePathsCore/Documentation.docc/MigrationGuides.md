# Migration guides

Learn how to upgrade your application to the newest version of Case Paths.

## Overview

Case Paths is under constant development, and we are always looking for ways to simplify the
library, and make it more powerful. As such, we often need to deprecate certain APIs in favor of
newer ones. We recommend people update their code as quickly as possible to the newest APIs, and
these guides contain tips to do so.
